# Instacart

## Proposal
Currently more and more people use to order groceries online and, together, more online delivery companies like Instacart are arising.  
Instacart provides a dataset that contains the information of about 3.4 million online grocery orders, including the time between orders of the same costumer, day of the week and hour of the day of the orders. Also the products in each order, if they are reordered and the order that they are put in the cart. We can use this data to learn the patterns of online grocery buyers to predict what they will order in the future and when. This will allow online grocery delivery companies to have the right amount of product and drivers ready for a fast and successful delivery. This data also will provide information to design new promotions to encourage new costumers to order for first time and existing costumers to reorder.
